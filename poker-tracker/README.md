# Poker Spreadsheet Maker

Hello, my name is Samson and I love to play poker. I made this spreadsheet creator to easily help me make a spreadsheet that keeps track of results for home games. 

Within the main.py file, lines 12 and 13 need to be changed to the preference of the user. For example, if your game consists of 3 people, you would enter the following:


people = ['example 1', 'example 2', 'example 3']

title = 'title goes here';

Currently, this project will not work unless you have the OAUTH credentials (which I have not included for obvious reasons). As a next step, I am working on making this project into a web application and creating an authentication server such that all users will be able to use it.
